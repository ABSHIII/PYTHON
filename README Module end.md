This project focuses on the analysis and preprocessing of a dataset to gain insights into various factors such as salary distribution and correlations with age. The preprocessing steps involved loading the data, cleaning it by handling missing values and duplicates, and transforming features to enhance analysis. Key tasks included analyzing salary expenditure by team, exploring the distribution of salaries by position, and examining the correlation between age and salary. Graphical representations were created, including a pie chart to visualize the distribution of age groups, a bar chart to show salary expenditure by team, and a scatter plot to highlight the relationship between age and salary. The project provided valuable insights into salary trends, pay structures, and potential growth based on age. This analysis was performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
